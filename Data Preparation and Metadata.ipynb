    "> __About the U.S. EPA Excess Food Opportunities Map:__ The U.S. EPA Excess Food Opportunities Map supports nationwide diversion of excess food from landfills. The interactive map identifies and displays facility-specific information about potential generators and recipients of excess food in the industrial, commercial and institutional sectors and also provides estimates of excess food by generator type.  The map displays the locations of nearly 950,000 potential excess food generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this project, only the following sources were used: food banks, food wholesale and retail, restaurants and food services.  Although the locations were provided by address, the data were pivoted and summarized at the state level.  A secondary dataset was obtained at the zipcode level for these data only and were not part of the combined dataset.\n",

    "> __Food Wholesale and Retail, US and Territories, 2023, EPA Region 9:__ Abstract: This table contains features that represent food wholesalers and retailers (supermarkets, grocery stores, and supercenters) represented by 24 unique NAICS codes. Establishment-specific information except the annual excess food estimate was licensed to the EPA from D&B Hoovers in 2021 (https://www.dnb.com/).  Calculations used to estimate annual excess food estimates are described in EPA’s 2023 publication: EPA Excess Food Opportunities Map Version 3 - Technical Methodology. The dataset contains 197,455 facilities.\n",

    "> __Restaurants and Food Services, US and Territories, 2023, EPA Region 9:__ Abstract: This table contains features that represent restaurants and caterers represented by six unique NAICS codes. Establishment-specific information except the annual excess food estimate was licensed to the EPA from D&B Hoovers in 2021 (https://www.dnb.com/). Calculations used to estimate annual excess food estimates are described in EPA’s 2023 publication: EPA Excess Food Opportunities Map Version 3 - Technical Methodology. The dataset contains 451,092 facilities. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Food Banks:__ Abstract: This layer contains point features that represent facilities that recover excess food to feed people across the US. Food bank information was collected in 2015 from Feeding America(www.feedingamerica.org), a national organization for food banks, and includes food banks as well as Partner Distribution Organizations (PDO) and Regional Distribution Organizations (RDO). Sources of annual excess food weight are described in EPA’s 2019 publication: Technical Methodology for the EPA Excess Food Opportunities Map. The dataset contains 316 facilities. This layer is not authoritative as the data is from 2015; this layer is planned to be updated and replaced in 2024.\n",

Estimated prevalence rates of food insecurity during this 3-year period ranged from 7.4 percent in New Hampshire to 18.9 percent in Arkansas; estimated prevalence rates of very low food security ranged from 3.2 percent in Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and North Dakota to 7.0 percent in South Carolina.\n",
